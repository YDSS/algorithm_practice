# Google | Onsite | Design Twitch

Design a live broadcasting system like Twitch with the following functionalities:

- Live video stream
- Display total online users in the room (prompted me to talk about multiple different implementation & tradeoff)
- Send gifts to room owner with a message broadcasted to all users in the room ( assume multiple gifts & msg can appear on the same screen at once, how to make sure they are in order)
- Room chat function
- Playback video function should display gifts, screen messages, & chat to be shown again. (after broadcast is offline)
- Also asked about tradeoff on ajax polling, long polling, & web socket for each of the functionality and ask me which to use for each.
